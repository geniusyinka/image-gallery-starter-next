## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository by running the following command:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/><your-id>/image-gallery-starter-next.git
```

3. Enter the correct directory, install dependencies and run locally:

```bash
cd image-gallery-starter-next
npm i

```

4. Create a `.env`  and then supply the below Cloudinary config parameters from your console:

```jsx
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=
```

5.  Run locally:

```

6. Ensure that you install the Fleek CLI and the Fleek Next Adapter:

```bash
// local installation
npm i @fleek-platform/cli
npm i @fleek-platform/next

// global installation
npm i -g @fleek-platform/cli

ðŸ’¡: you can check the Fleek CLI version by running fleek -v. Any version >= 2.10.1 should be good. As for the Fleek Next adapter, you can check the Fleek Next Adapter version by running fleek-next -v. Any version >= 2.1.0 should be good.

## Building and Deploying

1. Add the following code to any routes that run server-side code to ensure they run on the edge:

```jsx
**export const runtime = 'edge';**
```

2. Build the project using the Fleek Next Adapter:

```bash
npx fleek-next build
# or if installed globally
fleek-next build
```

3. Now, Create the Fleek Function using the Fleek CLI:

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions create --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions create --name nextra
```

4. Finally, deploy using the Fleek CLI:

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static --name nextra
```
